# Month - April

## 2 - Wednessday
It's not perfect. Better than the previous.
Today I practiced typing in [monkeytype.com](https://monkeytype.com/) keeping my mind and finger steady.
I just noticed, I haven't varified my monkeytype account's linked email. Now I have.
Today I started 14 tests and completed them in 10 minutes and 16 second.
My typing speed is now 44 with accuracy 96
