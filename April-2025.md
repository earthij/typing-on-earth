# Month - April

## 2 - Wednessday
It's not perfect. Better than the previous.
Today I practiced typing in [monkeytype.com](https://monkeytype.com/) keeping my mind and finger steady.
I just noticed, I haven't varified my monkeytype account's linked email. Now I have.
Today I started 14 tests and completed them in 10 minutes and 16 second.
My typing speed is now 44 with accuracy 96

## 3 - Thursday
Today I practiced for a single 10 minute session.
But it said that it took too much time to record it.
So, It's not in my account record.

Then I did 3 more each of 2 minute adding up to 6 minutes.
But for the same reason 1 of the 3 is not recorded.

The summary is, I practiced typing for 16 minutes, and monkeytype recorded only 4 minutes.
Today my speed is [I don't know. I don't even want to know]

## 4 - Friday
It's 10:58 at the morning. I did 5 practice sessions each of 2 minutes adding up to a complete 10 minute period.
Today my mind is somewhat stablem It is possible that I might type for hours today.
If I do, I will write here.
Record was negative today. Monkeytype says that If I stay consistant on this pattern, My hourly word per  minute will decrease by 22.

## 6 - Sunday
Today I have reset my account on monkeytype.com

## 8 - Tuesday
30 seconds it is.
